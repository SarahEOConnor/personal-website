      <description>The problem I’m developing an R package called oxforddown to write my PhD thesis in R Markdown and format it with the time-tested OxThesis LaTeX template used by many an Oxford grad student.
However, one feature of the OxThesis template just wouldn’t play nicely with R Markdown:

It worked in the end (the source file for our paper is here, an R package with our template is here, and a related blog post is here).
However, one of the challenges along the way was that I was missing chunk options to be able to set all the necessary parameters from R Markdown.</description>
