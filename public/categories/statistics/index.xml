      <description>Learning statistics is unavoidable for researchers. Aside from a few last refuges like literary theory, philosophy, or ethnography, understanding the world by analysing quantitative data reigns king in nearly all fields.

If a social scientist wants to understand motivations of Trump vs Clinton voters, statistics tell her how many people to survey, and afterwards whether the voters are different.</description>
