The ReDD Workshop: Supporting People in Regaining Control Over Digital Device Use,"Constant digital connectivity can be challenging for mental wellbeing, and make it difficult to focus on academic work. With the University of Oxford's [Counselling Service](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/counselling), I run the ’Reducing Digital Distraction’ (ReDD) workshop, where students reflect on their struggles and goals around digital device use, and explore concrete tools and strategies for taking control.",[Workshop paper](/pdfs/2020-02-20_Lyngs_CHI2020_workshop_rethinking_mental_health.pdf) | [Materials](https://osf.io/hdvtm/),,,/images/redd-workshop/redd-logo-rect-small.jpg,/pdfs/2020-02-20_Lyngs_CHI2020_workshop_rethinking_mental_health.pdf,Reducing Digital Distraction logo
‘I Just Want to Hack Myself to Not Get Distracted’: Evaluating Design Interventions for Self-Control on Facebook,"Many people use browser extensions such as 'Newsfeed Eradicator' to make Facebook less distracting. We studied how removing the newsfeed or adding goal reminders on Facebook affect behaviour and perceived control. Both interventions helped people stay on task and avoid distraction, with large --- and distinct --- effects on behaviour.",[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04180.pdf) | [Data and materials](https://osf.io/qtg7h/) | [3-minute video teaser](https://youtu.be/zj9I-2gjths),https://youtu.be/zj9I-2gjths,https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsBpGkPV83w,,,
Self-Control in Cyberspace: Applying Dual Systems Theory to a Review of Digital Self-Control Tools,"No systematic reviews had been done of the hundreds of apps and browser extensions for supporting self-control over digital devices that are available on online stores. We reviewed design features in 367 such tools on the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores and analysed them using a dual systems model of self-regulation.",[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00157.pdf) | [Data and materials](https://osf.io/zyj4h/) | [3-minute video teaser](https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s),https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s,https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJf_F7faczU,,,
Workshop teaching: Reproducible research with R Markdown,"R Markdown allows you to mix text written in markdown with chunks of code in languages such as R or Python. It can be used as an interactive notebook for data analysis, and exported to a wide range of formats, including HTML, Microsoft Word, and PDF. I teach a 2-day workshop that introduces the essentials of R Markdown for reproducible research.",[GitHub](https://github.com/ulyngs/rmarkdown-workshop-2019) | [Course slides](https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/),,,/images/rmd-workshop_small.jpg,https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/,1st slide of Day 1 R Markdown workshop
`oxforddown`: Writing a reproducible Oxford University thesis in R Markdown,"I wanted to write my PhD thesis in R Markdown, and use a traditional Oxford University LaTeX template to format it. There were no existing R packages for this, so I developed one. The resulting package is called `oxforddown` and combines `bookdown` (with heavy inspiration from `thesisdown`) with the beautiful and time-tested [OxThesis](https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis) LaTeX template.",[GitHub](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown) | [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf1W1BBS9cU),,,/images/oxforddown_compiled_pdf_small.jpg,https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown,Screenshot of an oxforddown PDF compiled in Rstudio
