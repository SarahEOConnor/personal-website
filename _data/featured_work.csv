The ReDD Workshop: Supporting People in Regaining Control Over Digital Device Use,"Constant digital connectivity can be challenging for mental wellbeing, and make it difficult to focus on work. 
With the University of Oxford [Counselling Service](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/counselling), I created the ’Reducing Digital Distraction’ (ReDD) Workshop, where students reflect on struggles and goals for digital device use, and explore tools and strategies for regaining control.",[Workshop paper](/pdfs/2020-02-20_Lyngs_CHI2020_workshop_rethinking_mental_health.pdf) | [Materials](https://osf.io/hdvtm/),,,/images/redd-workshop/redd-logo-rect-small.jpg,/pdfs/2020-02-20_Lyngs_CHI2020_workshop_rethinking_mental_health.pdf,Reducing Digital Distraction logo
‘I Just Want to Hack Myself to Not Get Distracted’: Evaluating Design Interventions for Self-Control on Facebook,"Many people use browser extensions such as 'Newsfeed Eradicator' to make Facebook less distracting. We studied how removing the newsfeed or adding goal reminders on Facebook affect behaviour and perceived control. Both interventions helped people stay on task and avoid distraction, with large --- and distinct --- effects on behaviour.",[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04180.pdf) | [Data and materials](https://osf.io/qtg7h/) | [3-minute video teaser](https://youtu.be/zj9I-2gjths),https://youtu.be/zj9I-2gjths,https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsBpGkPV83w,,,
Self-Control in Cyberspace: Applying Dual Systems Theory to a Review of Digital Self-Control Tools,"Hundreds of apps and browser extensions promise to help people exercise self-control over digital device use by, e.g., removing distractions or limiting time spent. 
We reviewed design features in 367 such tools from the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores and analysed them using a dual systems model of self-regulation.",[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00157.pdf) | [Data and materials](https://osf.io/zyj4h/) | [3-minute video teaser](https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s),https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s,https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJf_F7faczU,,,
Workshop teaching: Reproducible research with R Markdown,"[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) lets you mix text written in markdown with chunks of code in languages such as R or Python. 
It can be used as interactive notebook for data analysis, or exported to a range of formats, such as HTML, Microsoft Word, and PDF. 
I teach a 2-day workshop introducing the essentials of R Markdown for reproducible research.",[GitHub](https://github.com/ulyngs/rmarkdown-workshop-2019) | [Course slides](https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/),,,/images/rmd-workshop_small.jpg,https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/,1st slide of Day 1 R Markdown workshop
`oxforddown`: Writing a reproducible Oxford University thesis in R Markdown,"I wanted to write my PhD thesis in R Markdown, and use a traditional Oxford University LaTeX template to format it. 
For this purpose, I created a package called `oxforddown` which combines `bookdown` (with heavy inspiration from `thesisdown`) with the beautiful and time-tested [OxThesis](https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis) LaTeX template.",[GitHub](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown) | [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf1W1BBS9cU),,,/images/oxforddown_compiled_pdf_small.jpg,https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown,Screenshot of an oxforddown PDF compiled in Rstudio
