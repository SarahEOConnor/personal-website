I am a computer scientist, cognitive psychologist, and musician. 
Currently, I am doing a PhD at Oxford University's [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ulrik.lyngs/), as part of the [Social Machines project](https://sociam.org). 

My research focuses on **attention management and self-control in relation to use of digital devices**. 
Outside academia, I play random instruments in [The Karaoke Collective](https://karaokecollective.com).

I may be available for speaking, teaching, or consultancy in relation to digital self-control and reproducible research with R Markdown, as well as for musical bookings --- do <a href="mailto:ulrik.lyngs@cs.ox.ac.uk?Subject=Contact%20through%20ulriklyngs.com" target="_top">get in touch.</a>

##### The ReDD Workshop: A Template for Supporting People in Regaining Control Over Digital Device Use

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> Students often struggle to get the benefits of digital connectivity without comprising their ability to be immersed in academic work or facing negative effects on their well-being. In collaboration with the Counselling Service at the University of Oxford, I run the ’Reducing Digital Distraction’ (ReDD) workshops, in which students reflect on their struggles and goals around digital device use, which they match with concrete tools and strategies.

##### ‘I Just Want to Hack Myself to Not Get Distracted’: Evaluating Design Interventions for Self-Control on Facebook
<div class="featured-links"> 
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04180.pdf) | [Data and materials](https://osf.io/qtg7h/)
</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> Hundreds of thousands of people use browser extensions such as 'Newsfeed Eradicator' to make Facebook less distracting. We tested how removing the newsfeed or adding goal prompts and reminders on Facebook affect behaviour and perceived control. We found that both interventions have large effects on behaviour and help people stay on task and avoid distraction. But goal reminders can be annoying, and removing the newsfeed make some fear missing out on information.

##### Self-Control in Cyberspace: Applying Dual Systems Theory to a Review of Digital Self-Control Tools

</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> We analyse 367 apps and browser extensions from the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores to identify common core design features and intervention strategies afforded by current tools for digital self-control. Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found.

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> R Markdown allows you to mix text written in markdown with chunks of code in languages such as R or Python. I teach a 2-day workshop that introduces the essentials of R Markdown and how to use it to write reproducible research papers.

##### `oxforddown`: A template for writing Oxford University theses in R Markdown
<div class="featured-links"> 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown) | [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf1W1BBS9cU)
</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> I wanted to write my PhD thesis in R Markdown, and use a traditional Oxford University LaTeX template to format it. There were no existing R packages for this, so I developed one. `oxforddown` combines `bookdown` (with heavy inspiration from `thesisdown`) and the beautiful and time-tested OxThesis LaTeX template.
