I am a computer scientist and cognitive psychologist, doing a PhD at [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ulrik.lyngs/), University of Oxford, in the [Human Centred Computing group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/HCC/).

My research focuses on **attention and self-control in relation to use of digital devices**. 
When I need a break from academia, I play various instruments in [The Karaoke Collective](https://karaokecollective.com).

I may be available for workshops on reproducible research with R Markdown, or on digital distraction, as well as for musical bookings --- do <a href="mailto:ulrik.lyngs@cs.ox.ac.uk?Subject=Contact%20through%20ulriklyngs.com" target="_top">get in touch.</a>

##### The ReDD Workshop: Supporting People in Regaining Control Over Digital Device Use
<div class="featured-links"> 
[Workshop paper](/pdfs/2020-02-20_Lyngs_CHI2020_workshop_rethinking_mental_health) | [Materials](https://osf.io/hdvtm/)
</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> Constant digital connectivity can be challenging for mental wellbeing, and make it difficult to focus on academic work.
With the University of Oxford's [Counselling Service](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/counselling), I run the ’Reducing Digital Distraction’ (ReDD) workshop, where students reflect on their struggles and goals around digital device use, and explore concrete tools and strategies for taking control.

##### ‘I Just Want to Hack Myself to Not Get Distracted’: Evaluating Design Interventions for Self-Control on Facebook
<div class="featured-links"> 
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04180.pdf) | [Data and materials](https://osf.io/qtg7h/)
</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary: </span>Many people use browser extensions such as 'Newsfeed Eradicator' to make Facebook less distracting. We studied how removing the newsfeed or adding goal prompts and reminders on Facebook affect behaviour and perceived control. Both interventions help people stay on task and avoid distraction, with large --- and distinct --- effects on behaviour.

</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> No systematic reviews have been done of the hundreds of apps and browser extensions for supporting self-control over digital devices that are available on online stores. We reviewed design features in 367 such tools on the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores and analysed them using a dual systems model of self-regulation.

##### Workshop teaching: Reproducible research with R Markdown

</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> R Markdown allows you to mix text written in markdown with chunks of code in languages such as R or Python. It can be used as an interactive notebook for data analysis, and can be exported to a wide range of formats, include PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word. I teach a 2-day workshop that introduces the essentials of R Markdown for reproducible research.

##### `oxforddown`: Writing a reproducible Oxford University thesis in R Markdown
<div class="featured-links"> 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown) | [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf1W1BBS9cU)
</div>

<span class="tldr-label">Summary:</span> I wanted to write my PhD thesis in R Markdown, and use a traditional Oxford University LaTeX template to format it. There were no existing R packages for this, so I developed one. The resulting package is called `oxforddown` and combines `bookdown` (with heavy inspiration from `thesisdown`) with the beautiful and time-tested OxThesis LaTeX template.
